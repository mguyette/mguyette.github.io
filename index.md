## About me
I have always been a numbers person.  In recent years, this propensity has led me to exploring many aspects of data science.  My interest in numbers, data, and problem-solving has allowed me to expand my skillset broadly over the past decade or so.  I started to learn how to code by learning R when I was working on my doctorate, and now I dabble in many languages and tools as I explore how best to tackle big and small problems.

I am currently a Technical Program Manager with the St. Johns River Water Management District in Florida.  I am responsible for managing the Water Quality Monitoring program for the District, from network design and data collection through quality assurance and communication (as well as a great deal of people management).  This job has provided me with opportunities to delve deeply into data, and I have worked with software and databases to help improve processes, expand our capabilities, and enhance internal and external user experiences.

Previously, I worked as a Water Resource Data Manager and an Environmental Scientist for the District.  In these positions, I also worked closely with the rich water quality and hydrologic data sets we have at the District.  I managed contracts and projects, performed statistical analyses to support management projects, and led an R Users Group to improve the District's R capabilities for accessing data and performing statistical analyses.  I streamlined data acquisition processes and provided technical support to colleagues with analytical or acquisition needs.

Before moving to Florida, I held two post-docs.  The first was at the University of Maine, where I created a vegetation map of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge using satellite imagery and a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification techniques.  I then modeled vegetation changes in response to fires in the Refuge using a Bayesian belief network assessment.  My second post-doc was at the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  There I modeled predictive native and invasive fish distributions while contributing to a project focused on restoring native fish migrations while controlling invasive species via optimization modeling for decision making.

I received my PhD in Wildlife Ecology from the University of Maine and my AB and MS in Ecology and Earth Sciences form Dartmouth College.  My doctoral research explored the responses of Atlantic salmon stream communities to marine-derived nutrients in Maine.  My undergrad and Master's theses explored trophic transfer of metals in stream food webs using nitrogen isotopes in a former mining district in Montana.  All of these academic experiences involved working with stable isotopes and extensive statistical work.
