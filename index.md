## About me
I have always been a numbers person.  In recent years, this propensity has led me to exploring many aspects of data science.  This started with learning R when I was working on my doctorate, and my skillset has expanded to include many other tools.<br><br>

I am a Technical Program Manager with the St. Johns River Water Management District in Florida.  I am responsible for managing the Water Quality Monitoring program for the District, from network design and data collection through quality assurance and communication.<br><br>

I received my PhD in Wildlife Ecology from the University of Maine and my AB and MS in Ecology and Earth Sciences form Dartmouth College.
