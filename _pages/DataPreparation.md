Throughout my career, as a graduate student, an Environmental Scientist, a Water Resource Data Manager, and now a Technical Program Manager, I have encountered diverse data sets stored in varied ways.  One of the key Data Science Skills is being able to work with the data you have, no matter how it's presented to you.  The following projects illustrate examples of data acquisition and cleaning for a variety of different purposes.

## Data Acquisition

[Retrieving USGS gauge data from NWIS](https://mguyette.github.io/QueryUSGS) [R](/Languages#r){: .btn .btn--info}  
I developed a simple R script that allows colleagues with limited R skills to easily retrieve and export USGS gauge data from the National Water Information System (NWIS), using the USGS R package *dataRetrieval*.

## Data Cleaning

<!--### Unstructured Data-->

[Extracting the period of record from an unstructured Hydstra export](https://mguyette.github.io/Hydstra_HYREPSummary) [R](/Languages#r){: .btn .btn--info}  
I was summarizing metadata on water sampling stations across the St. Johns River Water Management District, and I needed an efficient way to find the period of record for hydrologic sampling stations.  This project works with a report export from the program Hydstra.
