## Selected published work

Loftin, C.S., Guyette, M.Q., Wetzel, P.R. 2018. Evaluation of Vegetation-Fire Dynamics in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, Georgia, USA, with Bayesian Belief Networks. Wetlands. 38(4): 819-834. doi: [10.1007/s13157-018-1033-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-018-1033-6).

My contributions:
  - Created a post-fire (2011) vegetation map using SPOT imagery, ERDAS Imagine, ArcMap, and R, using a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification  
  - Developed a Bayesian Belief Network using [Netica](https://www.norsys.com/netica.html) and evaluated model sensitivity  
  - Analyzed modeled results with FRAGSTATS

My contributions:  
  - Performed all aspects of this work, from study design through analysis and writing  
  - Statistical analyses included parametric and nonparametric tests, including ANOVA, MANOVA, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests
